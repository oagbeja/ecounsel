societies, most individuals and nations of the world have invested greatly in education, so as to give 
every of its citizen the opportunity to go to school and contribute to the socio-economic development of 
their Nation.

career choices, lack of motivation/interest in programmes chosen, drop-outs in tertiary institutions, etc.

to candidates on the suitability or otherwise of their chosen career. Online career counselling system has emerged 
as a viable alternative to conventional physical face-to-face counseling system.

counsellor. It would be able to provide answers and guidance to students’ query especially in the areas of 
seeking for guidance in making good academic programme choice.
